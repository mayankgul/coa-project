                    Computer Organization and Architecture is a field of study
                    that explores the internal structure, design, and operation
                    of computer systems. It focuses on understanding how
                    computer hardware components interact to execute software
                    instructions, covering topics like processor design, memory
                    hierarchy, data flow, and instruction processing. This
                    knowledge provides insight into how a computer's hardware
                    and software are organized to optimize performance,
                    reliability, and efficiency. Learning COA helps students
                    grasp the fundamental principles behind computing devices,
                    preparing them to design more effective hardware and improve
                    software compatibility with underlying architecture.
